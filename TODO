•	`Color for Qualities (2 Hours)`

•	Adding some instructions (pop up) (4 Hours)
•	Force button (way to get around a team not inputting decisions) (2 Hours)
•	`** Salting & hashing passwords (2 Hours)` Need to install on server/put back on package.json
•	`Removing the professor radio button from the create user screen`
•	Protecting URLs

•	Increase number of buyers/sellers

## Later
•	(Option for) show asking prices all at once
•	More testing with multiple players
•	Adding an email address field for future use
•   Toggle leaderboard
•   Worksheet download
•   Viewport for Mobile (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_viewport.asp)
